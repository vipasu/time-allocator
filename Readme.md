This is a program designed to help remind you what things are important to you.
The basic idea is that we have lots of pockets of time that are spent idling -
a half hour here, another fifteen minutes there. Who will notice?

With thirty minutes between classes, it may seem like there's not much you can
do, but honestly, a half hour spent focused on a task can often make a huge difference.

The goal here is basically to spit out something that aligns with your
interests and fits however much time you specify. Have an hour to kill before
lunch? Type "python priority.py 60" to get back something that you have always
wanted to do but didn't already budget time for previously.

TODO List:
- add parsing for command line args
- different options for number of tasks
- ability to choose a subject
- add productivity related things
- inverse time difference weighting
- add tags/project
